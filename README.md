# Matt Jennings 10up Senior Front End Engineering Technical Challenge Details

1. Theme I created from scratch is in the "10up-mj-theme" directory.

2. I used flexbox heavily to center items. I didn't have time to test in various browsers using https://www.browserstack.com/ but normally do that.

3. The search button and mobile nav button are each accessible.

4. I used Gulp to minify JS and convert Sass to CSS (including minifying the CSS).

5. I used Adobe Illustrator to convert some SVG files from black outlines to white.

6. The LIVE website is viewable at:
